## Work done so far

<!-- What has been done so far -->

Comprehension of the model used in the gerstung lab paper. Statistical distributions that were used were also intuitively understood. Distributions like negative binomial, Dirichlet multinomial; Concepts like spline function, convolution, multinomial and multivariate were all read and understood.

### Gerstung Lab paper

[[Doubts and answers|Growth_Rate_Estimation.GerstungLab#doubts-and-answers]]


<!-- Any doubts to be cleared -->

## Next Step

<!-- What should  I work on till the next meeting-->
- We are not going to implement the Gerstung lab paper
- See if gerstung lab program works for their data set, modulate the parameters and see what happens
- Look into more approaches that handle epidemic data and choose what can be reimplemented.

## Tasks

<!-- You can add any follow up items here. If they require more detail, you can use `Create Task Note` to create each follow up item as a separate note. -->

- [ ] Run the program with their data and then try repeating with german data
- [ ] Read given papers and about the R package
