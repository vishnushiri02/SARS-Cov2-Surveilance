|DATE|TASK THAT WAS HANDLED| DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK PERFORMED TODAY|
|--|--|--|
|22-6-23| [[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]]|Managed to read and understand the few fundamentals of the model and started the [[Growth_Rate_Estimation.GerstungLab]] note|
|23-6-23|[[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]]|Continued Reading through the model. I am not keeping well today|
|24-6-23 to 13-7-23| No Tasks done | Reason: Events in India|
|14-7-23| Catching up| Reading through my notes|
|17-7-23| [[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]] | Continuing to read through the paper and noted few doubts|
|18-7-23| Work at Centogene||
|19-7-23| Work at Centogene||
|20-7-23 to 24-7-23| Break| Not in town|
|25 -7- 23|[[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]]|Understanding the basic intuition of the model by brushing through concepts - basic statistics, convolution.|
|26-7-23|[[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]]| The growth rate is obtained by differentiating the spline functions - So tried to understand spline interpolation and cubic spline basis|
|27-7-23|[[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]]|Trying to get more sense regarding incidence|
|28-7-23|[[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]]|Revisiting Binomial and Negative binomial distribution, Difference between incidence and growth rate. How can growth rate be calculated from incidence.|
|29,30-7-23| - | Weekend|
|31-7-23|[[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]]|Gamma Distribution, Growth rate and instantaneous reproduction number.|
|1-8-23|[[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]]|Genomic Prevalance, Logit function|
|2-8-23|Work at Centogene||
|3-8-23|[[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]]|Logit and logistic function,Dirichlet–Multinomial Models, Genomic prevalance|
|4-8-23|[[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]]|Beta Distribution,Dirichlet distribution|
|5,6-8-23|-|Weekend|
|7-8-23|[[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]]| Dirichlet distribution and Dirichlet-multinomial distribution|
|8-8-23|[[Model study\|meet.2023.05.31#next-step]]|Read through the paper, Tried to get the overall picture of the model intuitively and also tried to answer my doubts|
|9-8-23|[[meet.2023.08.09]]|Meeting, Filled the document with the answers to the doubts, pushed to git|
|10-8-23|[[More methods to get growth rate\|meet.2023.08.09#next-step]]||
