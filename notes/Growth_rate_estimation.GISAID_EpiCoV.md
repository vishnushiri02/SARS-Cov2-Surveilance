# Mission:

1. A platform for sharing data regarding viral diseases - It has information about flu,Covid-19,pox and about diseases like dengue,zika virus, yellow fever etc.
2. Information about genetic sequences (collected and deposited from worldwide sources), annalysis data, phylogenetic analysis, 3D protein models, drug targets are all available.
3. The initiative ensures the open access to data in GISAID and also ensures the prevention of sharing the virological data prior to formal publication.

[History behind the introduction of GISAID](https://gisaid.org/about-us/history/)

EpiCoV page contains
1. Audacity : Global phylogenetic tree of SARS CoV-2
2. AudacityInstant: _Nothing loads_
3. BLAST : BLAST search against sequences collected during the last 3 months
4. CoVizu : visualization of SARS-CoV2 genomic variation
5. Emerging Varaints: This site helps to monitor emerging hCoV-19 variants that could become relevant due to signs of increased spread (estimated by change in number of locations) combined with potential effects on receptor or antibody binding as annotated in CoVsurve.
6. Lineage Frequency: Frequency of each lineages globally/for each country month wise for an year I suppose.
7. Official GISAID refernce sequence : Contains the Wuhan viral sequnce and the ORF nucleotide sequences and the protein sequences.
8. PrimerChecker: PrimerChecker uses the blastn algorithm from Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) with parameters for short sequence matches to search primers against high quality sequences within GISAIDâ€™s database
9. Submissiontracker: Table containing the conuntrywise number of sequences shared, number of reported covid-19 cases, Reported deaths from covid-19, % of cases sequneced and shared, The most recent submission(number of days ago)
10. Spike glycoprotein mutation surveillance: GISAID automatically updates this site daily. The updates include spike protein changes in sequences submitted to GISAID with collection date within the past 60 days, displayed in structures organized by the fastest spreading lineages and color-coded for the change type including changes of the receptor binding interface.
11. wastewater: This subset comprises entries from wastewater surveillance, and includes entries with substantially lower sequence coverage
that may result in incomplete annotations for variant, clade, lineage and AA substitutions.
