## A New Framework and Software to Estimate Time-Varying Reproduction Numbers During Epidemics - Anne Cori.

### Crux of the paper

+ Motivation of the paper:
  1. Methods based on fitting mechanistic transmission models to incidence data are often difficult to generalize because of the context-specific assumptions often made(e.g., presence/absence of a latency period or size of the population studied).
  2. Though Wallinga and Teunis method is generaic it is based on the probabilistic reconstruction of transmission trees and on counting the number of secondary cases per infected individ- ual. The method estimates 1 value of R per time step of inci- dence. Which would make the curve very swiggly. If this curve is smoothened then it would be sensitive to smoothing parameters.
  3. The aim of the study was to develop a generic and robust tool for estimating the time-varying reproduction number, similar in spirit to earlier methods, but implemented with ready-to-use software
