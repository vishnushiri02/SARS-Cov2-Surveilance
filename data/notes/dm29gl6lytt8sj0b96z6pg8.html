<ul>
<li>R<sub>0</sub> and R<sub>t</sub> are important measure of the progression of an epidemic</li>
<li>It is used for the policy formulation.</li>
<li>The value of R matters – not just whether it is greater or less than 1 – but because the value of R when greater than unity tells you what proportion of new infections you need to prevent in order to go from increasing incidence to stable or decreasing incidence.</li>
<li>In addition, the magnitude of R<sub>0</sub> <a href="/SARS-Cov2-Surveilance/notes/rfr63bef0sa84zpwv9fw1w0#r0basic-reproduction-number">(Basic Reproduction Number):</a> also provides information on what level of herd immunity will drive the value of R to less than unity such that the infection cannot persist.</li>
<li>This gives the target for vaccination programmes of what fraction of the community to immunise. As a rough approximation, the expression p=1-1/R<sub>0</sub> gives the critical proportion (or percentage) p that must be immune if transmission is to be halted. For a value of 2.5 as recorded in Wuhan in the early stages of the epidemic, this critical proportion is 0.6 or 60%. That is : 1 primary infection causes 2.5 secondary infections. So 1/2.5 primary infection causes 1 secondary infection. So to get a 1 as secondary infection there must be only 1/2.5 primary infection which means 1-1/2.5 should be immunised which is 60%.<a href="./assets/Reference%20literature/set-covid-19-R-estimates.pdf">1</a></li>

<li>Serial interval in the case of COVID-19 has less relevance given that many infections especially in the young do not seem to generate marked

<li>shorter generation times early in the epidemic,
and longer ones as the epidemic is declining</li>
<li>For a highly variable incubation period there may be negative serial intervals, which may
be misinterpreted as the wrong direction of transmission.If the wrong direction of transmission is assumed, contact tracing efforts may stop prematurely and miss new infections that then may lead to further uncontrolled transmission events.<a href="./assets/Reference%20literature/set-covid-19-R-estimates.pdf">1</a></li>

<p>  To explain the relationship between R and time an comparison is provided by HIV, which has an R<sub>0</sub> of around 2 in some populations, and influenza, which has an R<sub>0</sub> around 1.329, the most important being the reproduction number R, but the timescale from one infection to the next is days for influenza but months or years for HIV.<a href="./assets/Reference%20literature/set-covid-19-R-estimates.pdf">1</a></p>

<h2 id="using-epidemic-growthrate"><strong>Using Epidemic growthrate</strong><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#using-epidemic-growthrate"></a></h2>
<p>  Epidemic growth rate is a measure of the speed of epidemic growth, conveying information about the time scale of disease spread. In contrast, R<sub>0</sub>is a pure number with no associated time scale; epidemics with the same R<sub>0</sub>
can occur over vastly different time periods, ranging from days to years. Knowing the epidemic time frame can be critical for selection of disease control strategies. Secondly, r itself is independent of potentially uncertain knowledge about the generation interval distribution, and thus may be useful in comparing the severity of disease epidemics.<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-013-9918-2">2</a>
Epidemic growth rate r itself can only be directly measured providing case reporting, hospital admissions, recorded deaths due to COVID-19 or serological data.
but when the main source
of data is deaths other information is required such as the probability distribution of times from infection to death
and the fraction who die from infection.<a href="./assets/Reference%20literature/set-covid-19-R-estimates.pdf">1</a></p>
