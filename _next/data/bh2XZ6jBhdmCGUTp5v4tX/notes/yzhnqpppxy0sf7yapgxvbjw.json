Parametric model fitting is done by using package FME (Flexible Modelling Environment) of Soetaert and Petzoldt (2010). In addition to growth models given in closed form (i.e. empirical regression equations or analytical solutions of differential equations) it is also possible to use numerically integrated systems of differential equation. Such models are then solved with package `deSolve’ (Soetaert, Petzoldt, and Setzer 2010).<br> 2. Fitting of linear models to the period of exponential growth using the ``growth rates made easy method’’ of Hall et al. (2014) , <br>3. Nonparametric growthrate estimation by using smoothers.

The risk-based model builds on the fact that the amount of 'risky' behaviour is not distributed equally among the population.
