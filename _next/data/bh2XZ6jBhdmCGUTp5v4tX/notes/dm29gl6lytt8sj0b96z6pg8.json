As a rough approximation, the expression p=1-1/R<sub>0</sub> gives the critical proportion (or percentage) p that must be immune if transmission is to be halted. For a value of 2.5 as recorded in Wuhan in the early stages of the epidemic, this critical proportion is 0.6 or 60%. That is : 1 primary infection causes 2.5 secondary infections. So 1/2.5 primary infection causes 1 secondary infection. So to get a 1 as secondary infection there must be only 1/2.5 primary infection which means 1-1/2.5 should be immunised which is 60%.<a href=\"./assets/Reference%20literature/set-covid-19-R-estimates.pdf\">1</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"dynamics-of-serialgeneration-interval\"><strong>Dynamics of Serial/Generation interval</strong><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#dynamics-of-serialgeneration-interval\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/SARS-Cov2-Surveilance/notes/rfr63bef0sa84zpwv9fw1w0#generation-time\">Generation Time</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/SARS-Cov2-Surveilance/notes/rfr63bef0sa84zpwv9fw1w0#serial-interval\">Serial interval</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Serial interval in the case of COVID-19 has less relevance given that many infections especially in the young do not seem to generate marked\nand easily identifiable symptoms.</li>\n<li>The interventions that are put into places will affect the dynamics of both serial interval and generation time.\n<ol>\n<li>shorter generation times early in the epidemic,\nand longer ones as the epidemic is declining</li>\n<li>For a highly variable incubation period there may be negative serial intervals, which may\nbe misinterpreted as the wrong direction of transmission.If the wrong direction of transmission is assumed, contact tracing efforts may stop prematurely and miss new infections that then may lead to further uncontrolled transmission events.<a href=\"./assets/Reference%20literature/set-covid-19-R-estimates.pdf\">1</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"relationship-between-generation-time-serial-interval-epidemic-growth-and-reproduction-number\"><strong>Relationship between Generation time/ Serial interval, epidemic growth and Reproduction number</strong><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#relationship-between-generation-time-serial-interval-epidemic-growth-and-reproduction-number\"></a></h2>\n<pre><code>   r = (R0-1)/Ƭ \n</code></pre>\n<p>  To explain the relationship between R and time an comparison is provided by HIV, which has an R<sub>0</sub> of around 2 in some populations, and influenza, which has an R<sub>0</sub> around 1.329, the most important being the reproduction number R, but the timescale from one infection to the next is days for influenza but months or years for HIV.<a href=\"./assets/Reference%20literature/set-covid-19-R-estimates.pdf\">1</a></p>\n<p>  <a href=\"/SARS-Cov2-Surveilance/notes/rfr63bef0sa84zpwv9fw1w0#epidemic-growth-rate\">Epidemic Growth rate</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"using-epidemic-growthrate\"><strong>Using Epidemic growthrate</strong><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#using-epidemic-growthrate\"></a></h2>\n<p>  Epidemic growth rate is a measure of the speed of epidemic growth, conveying information about the time scale of disease spread. In contrast, R<sub>0</sub>is a pure number with no associated time scale; epidemics with the same R<sub>0</sub>\ncan occur over vastly different time periods, ranging from days to years. Knowing the epidemic time frame can be critical for selection of disease control strategies. Secondly, r itself is independent of potentially uncertain knowledge about the generation interval distribution, and thus may be useful in comparing the severity of disease epidemics.<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-013-9918-2\">2</a>\nEpidemic growth rate r itself can only be directly measured providing case reporting, hospital admissions, recorded deaths due to COVID-19 or serological data.\nbut when the main source\nof data is deaths other information is required such as the probability distribution of times from infection to death\nand the fraction who die from infection.<a href=\"./assets/Reference%20literature/set-covid-19-R-estimates.pdf\">1</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"resources-that-can-be-used-for-the-dissertation\"><strong>Resources that can be used for the dissertation</strong>:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#resources-that-can-be-used-for-the-dissertation\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ijccm.org/doi/pdf/10.5005/jp-journals-10071-23649\">Achaiah, Nithya C et al. “R0 and Re of COVID-19: Can We Predict When the Pandemic Outbreak will be Contained?.” Indian journal of critical care medicine : peer-reviewed, official publication of Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine vol. 24,11 (2020): 1125-1127. doi:10.5005/jp-journals-10071-23649</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!--References-->\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/SARS-Cov2-Surveilance/notes/rfr63bef0sa84zpwv9fw1w0\">Glossary</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"k0mebzuguvky0evky4565pp","title":"Master Thesis documentation","desc":"All the documentation concerning the master thesis work","updated":1694683146686,"created":1686559402300,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Literature"},"contentHash":"c09d70349d92219d2331e5f9194e5d40","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"k0mebzuguvky0evky4565pp","vaultName":"Literature"},"value":"Growth_rate_Estimation","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":3,"offset":2},"end":{"line":1,"column":29,"offset":28},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"Growth_rate_Estimation"}}],"anchors":{"":{"type":"header","text":"","value":"","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["yzhnqpppxy0sf7yapgxvbjw","qr9otvt7um9wubucm04d6on","1p3762rhejdcytrms2q3uzf","7el5m7bmwl0usxvac72hp2z"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# [[Growth_rate_Estimation]]\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Literature"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"Personal Knowledge Space"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","siteUrl":"https://vishnushiri02.github.io","assetsPrefix":"/SARS-Cov2-Surveilance","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
